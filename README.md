1. Data Collection Layer

    Purpose: Fetch real-time price data from multiple exchanges.

    Implementation:

        Use Goroutines for concurrent API calls (crypto & stocks).

        APIs:

            Crypto: Binance, Coinbase Pro, KuCoin

            Stocks: Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io

        Store data in PostgreSQL (historical) + Redis (fast access for live analysis).

    Go packages:

        net/http or resty for API calls

        encoding/json for parsing

2. Indicator Calculation Engine

    Purpose: Compute technical indicators.

    Examples:

        RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands

    How:

        Implement indicator formulas in Go or use libraries like:

            github.com/markcheno/go-talib (TA-Lib for Go)

    Design:

        Run calculations in parallel using Goroutines.

        Cache latest indicators in Redis.

3. Signal Generator

    Purpose: Turn indicator values into Buy/Sell/Hold signals.

    Example Rules:

        RSI < 30 → Strong Buy

        RSI > 70 → Strong Sell

        MA(50) crosses MA(200) → Bullish signal

    Future Upgrade: Add ML models via Python microservice if needed.

    Output: Signals stored in DB + pushed to notification service.

4. Storage Layer

    PostgreSQL:

        Market data (candlesticks)

        Historical signals

        User subscriptions

    Redis:

        Latest prices & signals for real-time performance

5. Notification Layer

    Channels:

        Telegram Bot (popular for crypto)

        Email alerts (SES, Mailgun)

        WebSocket push for dashboard

    Implementation in Go:

        Use tgbotapi for Telegram

        Use net/smtp or 3rd party for email

        Build WebSocket server with gorilla/websocket

6. Frontend

    Nuxt.js + Tailwind

        Dashboard showing:

            Live prices

            Signals with confidence scores

            Historical charts (use TradingView widget or Chart.js)

        Login + subscription management (Stripe)

    API: Expose via Go REST API (or gRPC for future scalability)

✅ MVP Scope

    Crypto-only to start (BTC, ETH)

    Indicators: RSI + EMA

    Signals: Buy / Sell based on RSI thresholds

    Telegram alerts + Web dashboard

    Basic user auth
